# Breadth-First Search with Linear Algebra Methods
An implementation of a rudimentary Breadth-First Search using Linear Algebra Methods. The script is based on [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7046157) and implements a modified, rudimentary, version using repeated matrix multiplication to determine if a path exists between two vertices, and the number of steps involved.
